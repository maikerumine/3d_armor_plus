[mod] Visible Player Armor Plus[3d_armor_plus]
=====================================

Add-on for Minetest Game by: maikerumine
Adds special new armour for an extra boost in abilities and penalties.

Depends: default, 3d_armor

Recommends: inventory_plus or unified_inventory (use only one)

Adds craftable armor that is visible to other players. Each armor item worn contributes to
a player's armor group level making them less vulnerable to weapons.

Armor takes damage when a player is hurt but also offers a percentage chance of healing.
Overall level is boosted by 10% when wearing a full matching set.

Fire protection added by TenPlus1 when using crystal armor if Ethereal mod active, level 1
protects against torches, level 2 for crystal spike, level 3 for fire, level 5 for lava.

Configuration
-------------

Armor can be configured by adding a file called armor.conf in 3d_armor mod and/or world directory.
see armor.conf.example for all available options.

Note: worldpath config settings override any settings made in the mod's directory.
